### **Key Components**

1. **AdvancedCrossChainResolver** (`src/resolver/AdvancedResolver.ts`)

   - Main resolver class with event-driven architecture
   - Handles both ETH→TRX and TRX→ETH swap coordination
   - Implements intelligent retry logic and error recovery

2. **PerformanceMetrics** (`src/resolver/PerformanceMetrics.ts`)

   - Tracks success rates, latency, volume, and uptime
   - Provides rolling averages and percentile statistics
   - Exports metrics in Prometheus format

3. **Type System** (`src/resolver/types.ts`)

   - Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces and types
   - Error classes for different failure scenarios
   - Configuration and status interfaces

4. **Health Monitoring** (`src/resolver/index.ts`)
   - HTTP server with health, status, and metrics endpoints
   - Graceful shutdown handling
   - Process monitoring and error recovery

### **Advanced Features**

1. **Real-Time Event Monitoring**

   ```typescript
   // Ethereum WebSocket monitoring
   ethEscrowFactoryWs.on(
     "EscrowCreated",
     async (escrowId, initiator, resolver, amount, secretHash, event) => {
       if (resolver.toLowerCase() === this.getResolverAddress().toLowerCase()) {
         await this.handleEthereumEscrowCreated(escrowId, event);
       }
     }
   );

   // Tron polling (due to limited WebSocket support)
   setInterval(async () => {
     await this.pollTronEvents();
   }, 3000);
   ```

2. **Intelligent Failure Recovery**

   ```typescript
   // Exponential backoff retry
   for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= 3; attempt++) {
     const delay = Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000; // 2s, 4s, 8s
     await this.sleep(delay);

     try {
       await this.retryFailedOperation(swapContext);
       return; // Success
     } catch (retryError) {
       // Continue to next attempt
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Performance Metrics Collection**
   ```typescript
   // Real-time metrics tracking
   recordSwapSuccess(latencyMs: number, volumeWei?: bigint): void {
     this.totalSwaps++;
     this.successfulSwaps++;
     this.latencies.push(latencyMs);
     this.trimRecentMetrics();
   }
   ```
